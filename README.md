# covid_data
I used data from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. Unfortunately I can't upload it here, becasue size is too big.
I downloaded this data as xlsx file then converted to csv and sql using python. Then I did queries save new tables as csv files and converted to xlsx using python.
So you can see new data that i did from sql in five xlsx files.
