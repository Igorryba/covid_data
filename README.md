# covid_data
I used data from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths and divided it into 2 smaller datasets named covid_deaths and covid_vaccinations. 
I downloaded this datasets as xlsx files then converted to SQL using Python. Then I did queries save new tables as csv files and converted to xlsx using Python.
So you can see new Excel files which I create using queries and Python in query_results file.
To see this files you have to click on it and download by clicking 'view raw'.
